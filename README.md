# Palworld Dedicated Server

Hello and welcome! Hopefully this can help anyone get up and running with Palwolrd!

Issues are welcome but pull requests are even more welcome if you can!

## Specials thanks

My work are based on the docker server of satisfactory from [wolveix](https://github.com/wolveix/satisfactory-server)

## Background

I spun this up initially because well like anyone else, I wanted to run a dedicated server, but with a docker images who can edit the configuration ini.

This image is based on cm2network/steamcmd image and built out using a combination of help from the satisfactory and valheim images using the same base.

I used my previous scripts from Frozen Flame, and now you have this image.

## Setup

For people who want use the image you can use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) up -d:
```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  palworld:
    container_name: palworld-server
    hostname: palworld-server
    image: ghcr.io/studyfranco/palworld-docker:master
    #network_mode: "host"
    volumes:
      - "/path/to/config:/config"
    ports:
      - 8211:8211/udp
      - 27017:27017/udp
    expose:
      - 8211/udp
      - 27017/udp
    environment:
      - "SERVER_NAME=PalworldServerByMe"
      - "SERVER_PORT=8211"
      - "RCON_PORT=27017"
      - "RCON_PASSWORD=password"
      - "MAXPLAYERS=32"
      - "SERVERPASSWORD=password"
      - "PUID=2198"
      - "PGID=2198"
      - "TZ=Etc/UTC"
    tmpfs:
      - "/run:exec,mode=777"
      - "/tmp:exec,mode=777"
      - "/tmp/dumps:exec,mode=777"
      - "/var/tmp:exec,mode=777"
      - "/config/gamefiles/steamapps/temp:uid=2198,gid=2198"
    restart: "unless-stopped"
```
You can use the safer way with ports forwarding, or the network mod host.

Or you can use a quick and dirty `docker run`:
```bash
run -d --net=host -v </path/to/config>:/config --name=palworld-dedicated ghcr.io/studyfranco/palworld-docker:main 
```
This is currently using the host network simplicity but you should be able to map the ports how you wish without it, but that's untested by me.
